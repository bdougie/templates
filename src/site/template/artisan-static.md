A starter template for building a static Jigsaw blog hosted on Netlify.

This comes with code highlighting, share buttons, comments, analytics, a contact form, a CMS and more.

This template has extremely minimal HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which makes the code easy to build on top of or replace completely.
